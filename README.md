# Description 
There are an infinite number of prime numbers. Amongst the primes there are what are known as twin primes.

A twin primes is a prime that has a prime gap of two. For exampe, (41, 43) is a twin prime pair.

THe task of this project is to write a parallel program that can count the number of primes less than n for any number n and also finds and lists all twin primes less than n.
